= Simpler traces for the GEMOC Studio

A first attempt at execution traces that are _not_ multidimensional â€” except for the fact that we store all versions of each runtime-only element throughout the trace.

This repository includes:

- A self-contained Ecore trace metamodel (no dependencies on GEMOC Studio internal types),
- A GEMOC Execution Addon able to create execution traces conforming to this metamodel.
